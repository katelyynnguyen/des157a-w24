                <h2>critiqued by:</h2><p>Rheiana Mirazen Cuevas and Bill Mead</p>
                <p>Rheiana is my class’s undergrad design tutor and Bill is the professor for this course.</p>

                <h2>design critique notes</h2>

                    Rheiana:<br>
                    OMG so cool and cute!! I think your designs are clean and visually appealing. I really like your color palette and it's very fitting for the cards/casino theme. The cards are really cute too! I don't have much feedback on the layout and the designs; however, if you want to add more elements, I think creating a character for the dealer and the player would be great! It would be cool if the player wins, you can animate them being really happy and jumping up and down; the same goes with the dealer. The player could be a regular person just going into a casino then the dealer could be some middle aged guy with a mustache lol.

                    <ul>
                        <li>designs are really nice and fitting for the theme</li>
                        <li>liked how the instructions were hidden and were moved off of the main game page</li>
                        <li>liked the idea of having the elements be animated on the overlays</li>
                        <li>suggested looking online for apps/platforms to make GIFs–– lots of resources online</li>
                        <li>updated face cards are cool</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>project/code notes</h2>
                <p><span>*these are all from Bill as we looked at my code together*</span></p>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            to get new card images to be placed inside the div of the blue card placeholders, stick the HTML of the card divs into the JS file so that they’ll get put into those divs directly
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            in my HTML file, stick the card divs into the dealerHand and playerHand so that I can keep the JS portion as entering info into those divs using innerHTML
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            in my HTML file, stick the card divs into the dealerHand and playerHand so that I can keep the JS portion as entering info into those divs using innerHTML
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            to get the scores to show below the dealer: and player: headings, add tic marks, ${}, and a break tag in front so that the score will appear on the line below
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            helped me to condense my dealer and player score functions into 1, so that it just includes more if statements and loops
                        </li>
