                Since this game is based off a real game that my family plays during Chinese New Year, I wanted it to be more festive. I changed the whole theme of the game so that it's clear that it has a Chinese New Year feel with the lucky red and yellow colors. I also added some more graphic elements on the overlays and the face cards which I'm really happy about. They now include coins, dragons, firecrackers, decorative tags, and clouds. I'd like to add animations to the elements on the overlays so that it comes off as a bit more playful and festive. I also added a landing page for my game and I created an overlay for the instructions that appears once the page is loaded, and afterwards, it's hidden within the question mark button. I think this looks more visually appealing and it creates more space for the cards and the actual game. I also wanted to try to get the 'START' button to have a glowing effect because I feel like it would help it to stand out on the darker red background and it would draw users into playing the game more.
