                    The "<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>" article brought up some really good points that I didn’t think about before. One thing that was consistent with other UI/UX tips is to not overload your user with too much information. Therefore, it’s key to make sure your form is only asking for essential information otherwise users lose interest and are no longer committed to completing the form. The tip about using a one column layout was also really interesting to me. The author wrote that maintaining the vertical flow is important to keep the momentum going. This made me realize that sometimes having to scroll more in order to access all the information is better than it all being crammed into one page. This also made me think about the layout of my MadLibs 2.0 project. I originally had all my prompts fit the screen size; however, it was in a two column layout. After reading this article, I think I’ll go back to revise the layout for my project to ensure that my users don’t get lose interest when it comes to filling out my form.

                    Another tip I thought was interesting was to not use inline labels, which is where labels are placed within an input field. The reason for this is that once the user inputs information, the labels disappear and that makes it difficult for users to be sure they’re filling out eat field with the proper information. This is also another design flaw that I made in my MadLibs 2.0 project. In my input fields, I originally wanted to include inline labels; however, I think I’ll be rethinking that design choice in order to make my design easier for readers to understand.

                    I also really liked how the article stressed the importance of showing users their progress within the form or just where they are by highlighting the field that they’re currently working on. Reading this made a lot of sense to me and it made me think about my own experience with using forms. I realized that I really enjoy when a form includes some sort of progress bar to show me how much of the form I’ve completed and how much more I have to figure out. I also think it’s really helpful when I’m able to quickly notice which field I’m filling out by the outline being highlighted. This is especially useful incase I take a break from filling the form out or if I get distracted midway through. This is something that I’d like to implement in my MadLibs 2.0 project as well.

                    One website that includes these practices for form design is <a href="https://www.sephora.com/checkout/shipping">Sephora</a>. When checking out, form is broken down into different sections including: shipping address, shipping, gift message, and payment method. The section that you’re currently working on is expanded and the text is bold. The input field that you’re working on is also highlighted and the mandatory fields are marked with asterisks. The size of the text fields also correlate to the amount of information that should be inputted in each field.
