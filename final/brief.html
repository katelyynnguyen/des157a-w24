                <h2>project summary</h2>
                <p>
                    For my final project I plan to update my <a href="../studio3/index.html">Game On!</a> project because it’s interactive and I’d like to improve on the current design elements. This would involve more CSS and JavaScript, which is a challenge I’d like to take on.
                </p>

                <h2>project description</h2>
                <p>
                    My major focus of this project will be the <span>design</span> aspect. I’d like to create a separate rules page so that I’m able to create more space for the cards. The current readability for the rules is also not very good as the white text against a green background can be difficult to read, so I’d like to experiment with having the white text against either the blue or gray color.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the two players tie, I’d like to be able to have a “tie breaker” where another round of cards are drawn and whoever wins that hand will be the winner of the round. Currently, my game is only planned to announce that there’s a tie and no winner is actually announced.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since this is a card game that my family plays during Chinese New Year, I think I want to include some festive elements within the game as well to represent to the Year of the Dragon. For the face cards, I’m considering drawing a dragon to be included on the face cards and maybe some gold coins as well. For the overlay that appears when someone has a jackpot hand, I want to include an animation of a dragon and maybe some firecrackers. I’m not sure yet if I want to change my color palette that I have now to better suit the Chinese New Year theme, but it’s something that I’m considering. If this is the direction that I choose to go in, I’ll be sure to include more reds and yellows since these are considered lucky colors in my culture. 
                </p>

                <h2>expert feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m planning to ask my class undergrad design tutor, Rheina Cuevas, for her input on my designs and what she thinks works or is something that I can improve on. I also plan to ask Professor Katt Fontecha for her critique of my project. She was my professor for DES 112 - UI/UX Design during Winter quarter last year and I really enjoyed her class and teaching style. Her class peaked my interest in UI/UX and inspired me to explore the field further, so I think reaching out to her for advice would be really cool and kind of a full circle moment.
